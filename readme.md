> You need to export only buildAndStart () and appInstance used respectively to create and launch the application / access after creation. The application implementation is added to the NameSpace YUI3 by call YUI.add (...) method; and is available to be used by the called method YUI.use (...); 
> Note that the builders get the instance of YUI object provided by the script available at: "http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.16.0/build/yui/yui-min.js"
